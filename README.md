# SQL-Project: Library Management System

This is a comprehensive **SQL-based Library Management System** project that simulates the key operations and reporting functionalities of a real-world library. The project involves the design, implementation, and querying of a relational database using **MySQL**.

---

## Project Structure

The project is structured around 6 core tables:

1. **Branch** - Stores library branch information
2. **Employees** - Details of library staff
3. **Books** - Information on books available in the library
4. **Members** - Details of registered library members
5. **Issued_Status** - Tracks book issues to members
6. **Return_Status** - Tracks book returns and book condition

---

## Key Features Implemented

### **Database Creation and Schema Design**
- Creation of the `library_db` database
- Definition of tables with **primary** and **foreign key constraints**
- Proper normalization and relationship mapping

### **Data Insertion**
- Sample data inserted for all 6 tables
- Includes sample books, members, employees, branches, and issue/return records

---

## SQL Queries & Operations

### **CRUD Operations**
- Add new books, members, and update their details
- Issue and return books with condition tracking
- Delete specific records (e.g., issued books)

### **Reports & Analytical Queries**
- Books issued by employees
- Members with multiple book issues
- Book rental revenue by category
- Branch-wise performance report
- Overdue books with fines calculated
- Most active employees and branches
- Members with history of damaged book returns

### **Stored Procedures**
- `update_book_status`: Updates book status when returned, and logs book condition
- `book_status_management`: Manages issuance by checking availability and updating book status accordingly

---

## Highlights

- ‚úÖ **Overdue Tracking**: Includes a dedicated `overdue_summary` table showing fines and overdue counts
- ‚úÖ **Performance Reports**: `branch_performance_report` summarizes each branch‚Äôs activity and revenue
- ‚úÖ **Stored Procedures**: Simplify book issuing and return logic
- ‚úÖ **CTAS Usage**: Several tables created using `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) for summaries like:
  - `book_issue_summary`
  - `premium_books`
  - `active_members`
  - `overdue_summary`

---

## Sample Use Cases

- Track overdue members and fines automatically
- Get total revenue generated by each branch
- Identify employees handling the most book issues
- Monitor book conditions over time
- Automate book status updates on issue/return

## üìé Prerequisites

- MySQL Server (8.x recommended)
- MySQL Workbench or any compatible SQL editor
- Basic understanding of SQL DDL, DML, Joins, Procedures
